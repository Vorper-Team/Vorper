## Highlights

### Integrating with GitHub

After setting up our repository and adding some initial content, we wanted to make our deployment process much easier.

Then we stumbled upon **GitHub Actions**, a powerful automation tool that simplified our workflow. By configuring a deployment YML to run on every commit, we automated the build and deployment of our site to GitHub Pages, making our deployment process streamlined.

Woohoo! We didn't have to type `yarn deploy` everytime we wanted to deploy anymore. Here's a sneek peek of our deployment YAML, you can review the full thing at our GitHub repository.

```yml title=".github/deploy.yml"
deploy:
  name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
  needs: build

  # Grant GITHUB_TOKEN the permissions required to make a Pages deployment
  permissions:
    pages: write # to deploy to Pages
    id-token: write # to verify the deployment originates from an appropriate source

  # Deploy to the github-pages environment
  environment:
    name: github-pages
    url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
```

### Styles and Functions

With most of the `docusaurus.config.ts` being ready for deployment, we moved on to styling and add features to the site, and the first thing we had to do was setup Google Analytics and make dark mode, actually dark mode, by making it pure black.

Next up, we wrote an in-general [Terms of Service](/terms) that we would apply to the site, after that we wrote the privacy policy and a bunch of other stuff that was gonna be important for legal purposes. Once we were done with writing basic documents we moved on to deploying the site, and finally, writing this blog.

### Future Plans

Looking forward, we plan to explore more advanced features of Docusaurus (such as translation stuffs) and make the site look even better!

## Conclusion

Thanks to Docusaurus and a bunch of other stuff, we were able to make this site possible, see ya next time fellas.
