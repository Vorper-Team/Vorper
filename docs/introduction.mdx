# Introduction

:::info
This documentation is still under development so please help us out via PRs and other measures of assistance if you can.
:::

Vorper is a team of volunteering developers from across the world with a unified goal: to make free and open source software better and faster. As of August 03, Vorper has 3 members who contribute to various open source projects, either by translating, bug fixing, and or programming.

## Starting Vorper

When it was nearing the end of 2023, PH7NTOM had started to learn technology rapidly and explored a bunch of topics until he stumbled upon one that piqued his interest; open source. Once he found out how important open source was, he started Vorper, an organization to make open source better, and that's how we are here right now.

## Joining Vorper

If you are interested in working with us frequently you can do so via E-Mail or by contacting one of our team members directly, we provide hands-on training for early applicants such as you and offer a couple of other benefits listed below:

- **Access**: You will recieve access to all repositories owned by the Vorper organization on GitHub

- **Hosting**: You will be provided hosting for any service that you wish to run, it shouldn't be too intensive however

- **Storage**: You will be given access to a 20 GB private cloud storage solution hosted by us
